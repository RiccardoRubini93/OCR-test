- üìù **Handwriting Recognition**: Convert handwritten notes to digital text
- üîç **Research Projects**: Organize research materials and findings

### How to Use Projects

1. **Create a Project**: Click "New Project" and give it a descriptive name
2. **Add Description**: Optionally describe what the project is for
3. **Select Project**: Choose your project from the dropdown
4. **Process Documents**: All OCR results will be associated with your project
5. **Switch Projects**: Easily switch between different projects as needed

### Project Benefits
- **Organized Storage**: Keep related documents together
- **Better Search**: Find documents within specific projects
- **Context Awareness**: Always know what you're working on
- **Efficient Workflow**: Streamline your document processing
